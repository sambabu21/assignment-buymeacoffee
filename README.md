# React + Vite(Assignment for Buy Me A Coffee by Samjove Babu)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  
Introduction:
	Designed and developed website based on Design specs and instructions given. All functionalities have been implemented. Since manage creators navigation link was not specified in the design, i added it to the navbar and made it a protected route. I implemented a dummy sign in for this to follow the design specs.
